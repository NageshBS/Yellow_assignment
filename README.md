# Problem definition:
1. Use any API you are comfortable with and list 1000 restaurants closest to a user's current location
2. This list needs to be rendered on a Google map
3. Along with the 1000 closest restaurants, you will also need to list past 10 locations the user had launched this feature from
4. A web app / mobile app with any backend is acceptable. Use any programming language and make your code production ready.


# Steps to Run the Web Application:

1. Save the Yellow.py and Yellow_frontend.html files in the same directory.

2. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your system. If you haven't installed Flask, open a terminal/command prompt and run the following command:
pip install Flask

3. Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the app.py file, and run the following command to start the backend server:
python app.py

4. The server will start running on localhost.

5. Now, open a Yellow_frontend.html file in web browser.
